* Assets Under Management (AUM) : How much money is being managed by the fund
* 3 types of funds:
	1. ETF: Exchange Trade Funds: (4 letter symbols)
		* Buy/Sell like stocks
		* Baskets of stocks
		* Transparent
		* High liquidity
		* Fund Manager compensation: -- manner in which they are paid, incentives them to trade or act in certain ways -- based on how much the value of that fund increases
			* According to Expense Ratio (which is some percentage of the AUM) 
			* Usually pretty low (0.01% - 1.00%)
	2. Mutual Funds: (5 letter symbols)
		* Buy/Sell at end of day
		* Quarterly disclosure
			* less transparent
		* Fund Manager compensation: -- manner in which they are paid, incentives them to trade or act in certain ways -- based on how much the value of that fund increases
			* According to Expense Ratio
			* Somewhat higher than ETF's -- (0.5% - 3.00%)
			* These managers use more discretion and supposedly "skill" and so require larger compensation
	3. Hedge Funds: (not symbolized) -- typically have up to only 100 investors
		* Buy/Sell by agreement
		* No disclosure
			* Not transparent
		* Fund Manager compensation: -- manner in which they are paid, incentives them to trade or act in certain ways -- based on how much the value of that fund increases
			* According to "Two and Twenty" (2% AUM + 20% profits) -- "Two" is based on the hedge fund and when they choose to take snap shots of accounting -- usually a blend between some snap 
			shot and the profit return

	ex. Incentives: How are they compensated?
		* Two and Twenty
			* 15% return this year
			* $100,000,000 -> 15% -> $115,000,000

			* "Two" == $100,000,000 * 0.02 = $2,000,000
			* "Twenty" == $15,000,000 * 0.02 = $3,000,000 
				
	ex. Incentives: Which motivates...	Expense ratio		Two and Twenty
			* AUM accumulation		*			*	-- if strictly driven by expense ratio, you will be spending most energy towards accumulating AUM for a higher return
			* Profits						* 	-- only hedge fund managers make a percent of a return(profit) ETFs and Mutual Fund managers only receive expense ratio
			* Risk Taking						*	-- ETFs and MFs managers receive no reward for risk taking; HFs rewarded for risks (profits), & no punishment
											for risks because they still receive the "Two"

* Large Cap = capitalization: i.e., how much is the company worth according to number shares that are outstanding * price of the stock (what 1 share is selling at)
	* outstanding shares: refers to a company's stock currently held by all its shareholders, including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company's officers 
	and insiders

* How funds attract investors for hedge funds:
	* who?
		* individuals:
			* a single person (wealthy) who wants to invest in fund 
			* because a HF typically has only up to 100 investors, they want each of those investment/investor to be fairly large
		* institutions:
			* large retirement funds, university foundations -- very often non-profit institutions that have a very large sum of money that they need to keep somewhere and want to see an accrual 
			in value
		* funds of funds:
			* group together the funds of many individuals or institutions 
			* Manager decides which hedge funds to invest in 

	* why they might invest in your fund?
		* track record:
			* fund has a great track record = good evidence for continual success
			* many investors want to see a good track record for at least 5 years before they'll invest in a particular fund
		* simulation + story:
			* backtest/simulate your strategy
			* simulation must be backed by a very compelling story describing that strategy; i.e., must have a reason for why this method works and it needs to make sense
		* good portfolio fit:
			* how your strategy fits within their portfolio
			* ex., if your strategy is for large cap S&P500 stocks and they already have that covered, they probably wont consider you
			however, if you are looking at small cap growth stocks and they don't yet have that part of their portfolio filled, they'll give you more consideration


* Hedge Fund goals and metrics: when an investor is considering a particular hedge fund, they want to know what are the goals of the hedge funds, and the results of certain metrics
	* Goals:
		* Beat a benchmark (funds):
			* ex. you have a strategy that looks at the stocks in the SP500(SPY: 500 stocks), you are wise at seleting certain SP500 stocks and want to beat the SP500 index as a benchmark
			(the overall SP500 index has good and bad stocks) so if you picked the "good" ones you should beat the SP500 index 
			* Important component: 
				* many benchmarks (like the stock market as a whole) go down, it is of course natural that a portfolio consisting of stocks from that index might go down as well
					* so even though the index and the fund go down, you can outperform the index by going down less and still meet performance goals if index goes down more
		* Absolute return (funds):
			* Goal: provide positive return no matter what
			* usually long/short:
				* they make positive bets in stocks they think are going to go up and negative bets in stocks they think are going to go down 
			* objective: to make slow, gradual positive return no matter what
			* often times, these types of funds don't make the same percentage gains as the beat a benchmark funds, but they have very low drawdowns (i.e., when the market takes a big hit
			 they often don't)
	* Metrics: How to measure how well a fund is meeting its goals
		* cumulative return
			* a measure of aggregate amount an investment has gained or lost over given time -- (val[-1] / val[0]) - 1
			* if fund made 20% over a year, cumulative return is 0.2
		* volatility: Standard deviation of daily returns
			* how rapidly and aggressively the portfolio goes up and down in value -- (daily_ret.std())
		* risk/reward: Sharpe ratio
			* risk adjusted reward -- reward = average daily return - risk free rate ; risk = measure of standard deviation of daily returns
			* multiply by sqrt of k (constant representing frequency of sampling: 252 = daily, 12 = monthly, 1 = yearly)


* What is an order?
	* Components: the info that must go into a well formed order
		* buy/sell:
			* looking to buy or sell shares of stock  
		* symbol:
			* identifier for the stock or perhaps the ETF, that you want to buy or  sell
		* # shares
			* stocks and ETFs are sold in units of shares not by amount of money
		* limit or market:
			* market: you are willing to accept a good price but essentially whatever price the market is currently bearing
			* limit: you don't want to do any worse than a certain price -- must specify limit
		* price:
			* if limit order: must specify what the corresponding limit is (price)
			* if market order: you are not able to specify that price because with market order you are taking whatever price comes back
		* ex:
			* BUY, IBM, 100, LIMIT, 99.95 -- buy 100 shares of IBM at no more than $99.95 a share
			* SELL, GOOG, 150, MARKET
	* The Order Book:
		* each exchange keeps an order book for every stock that they buy or sell 
		* ex: 
			* first order of day -- used as basis to start building their order book 
				* BUY, IBM, 100, LIMIT, 99.95 -- buy 100 shares of IBM at no more than $99.95 a share
					* BID 99.95 100 -- someone bid 99.95 for a 100 shares of stock -- this is public knowledge (bidder id is NOT public, but is known to exchange) 
						* 100 gets larger depending on how many following orders come in
							* so far nothing has been bought or sold because we don't yet have anyone willing to sell 
			* first sell order of day
				* SELL, IBM, 1000, LIMIT, 100 -- but there is nobody yet willing to buy at $100 therefore exchange adds this order to its order book 
					* ASK 100.00 100
			* order book has grown over course of the day...
				* BID/ASK		PRICE			SIZE
				* ASK			100.10			100
				* ASK 			100.05			500
				* ASK			100.00			1000
				* BID			99.95			100
				* BID			99.90			50		
				* BID			99.85			50
			* a market order comes in...
				* BUY, IBM, 100, MARKET
					* here's what happens...
						* exchange looks at its order book, sees that there are shares for sale
							* exchange has to give client LOWEST PRICE (100.00)
			* order book has been updated after market order...
				* BID/ASK		PRICE			SIZE
				* ASK			100.10			100
				* ASK 			100.05			500
			-->	* ASK			100.00			900
				* BID			99.95			100
				* BID			99.90			50		
				* BID			99.85			50
			* The remaining stock price will probably go DOWN -- due to amount of stock for sale vs stock bids (i.e., more selling pressure)
				* if a market order to sell 500 shares came in, the price would immediately go down
				* if a market order to buy 500 shares came in, the price would remain the same

			* limit order comes in...
				* BUY, IBM, 100, LIMIT, 100.02
			* order book has been updated after market order...
				* BID/ASK		PRICE			SIZE
				* ASK			100.10			100
				* ASK 			100.05			500
			-->	* ASK			100.00			800	-- less than the limit price of 100.02
				* BID			99.95			100
				* BID			99.90			50		
				* BID			99.85			50

			* sell order comes in...
				* SELL, 175, MARKET
			* order book has been updated after market order...
				* BID/ASK		PRICE			SIZE
				* ASK			100.10			100
				* ASK 			100.05			500
				* ASK			100.00			800	
			-->	* BID			99.95			0	-- 100 shares at 99.95
				* BID			99.90			0	-- 50 at 99.90		
				* BID			99.85			25	-- 25 at 99.85
	
			* as times has gone on the executed prices have been decreasing -- as consequence of increased sell pressure

	* How orders get to the exchange from a person:
		1. buy order goes over internet to broker
		2. broker in turn is connected to several exchanges -- broker determines where to route your order based on information the broker knows about the exchanges 
			* NYSE			NASDAQ			BATS
			* order book		order book		order book 
			* broker has a computer located at each exchange, the broker queries the computer to look into the order book of each exchange for price information
			* broker routes your order based on exchange with best price 
		3. your order enters the exchange, gets executed
		4. the price comes back to your broker 
		5. price is forwarded back to you -- you recieve a confirmation
		* Brokerage -- internal transcactions:
			* if a brokerage has 2 clients (buy and sell) they can bypass the exchanges and make the transction internally
				* exchanges not involved
					* broker does not have to pay fees to the exchanges for the transaction
				* BY LAW -- BOTH BUYER AND SELLER MUST GET PRICES THAT ARE AT LEAST AS GOOD AS THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN HAD THEY GONE THROUGH AN EXCHANGE
					 -- TRANSACTION STILL MUST BE REGISTERED AT 1 OF THE EXCHANGES -- USUALLY RECORDED AT THE EXCHANGE WHERE THAT PARTICULAR STOCK IS HONED
		* Brokerage to brokerage transaction
			* requires a Dark Pool which acts as an intermediary between exchanges 
				* Dark Pool looks at the order books from the various exchanges and they are often making predications about which direction stocks are going to go
				* Dark Pools pay the brokers for privilege to look at the orders before they go to the exchanges -- and if the Dark Pools see an advantages trade they will go ahead and take it
				* route transactions -- avoid exchanges

	* How Hedge Funds exploit market mechanics:
		* distance between person and their broker and broker to an exchange results in increased time
		* hedge funds have co located computers at exchanges and so their proximity results in decreased time
		A. Order book exploit -- take advantage of proximity and resultant speed between remote buyers/sellers and exchanges
			1. Hedge fund observes order book (with decreased time) 
				* based on what it sees at the order book, it makes a predicition about price direction -- for example prices are going to go up
			2. Hedge fund buys stock
			3. you click "buy" stock -- requiring time for your order to make its way to the exchange
			4. meanwhile the price does go up
			5. your order finally is executed at the exchange -- in fact the hedge fund sells you the stock
				* Over the course of a few milliseconds, the hedge fund bought stocks, watched the price increase and sold the stocks
				* hedge fund exploits remote buyers/sellers because it can act much "earlier" than those remote buyers/sellers
		B. Geographic Arbitrage -- takes advantage of proximity and resultant speed between exchanges
			* NYSE			LONDON
			* lower price		higher price
			* HF colocated server	HF colocated server
			* buys low 		* sells high 
			

	* Additional order types:
		* exchanges
			* buy/sell
			* limit/market
		* broker:
			* buy/sell
			* limit/market
			* stop loss 
				* conditions: when stock drops to certain price, sell it 
			* stop gain
				* conditions: when stock reaches a certain price, sell it
			* trailing stop
				* automatically changing value for when a criteria is met
					* ex : 10 cents behind the price, when value goes up, trailing stop price goes up, but if price drops 10 below price a stop loss is triggered
			* selling short  -- MOST IMPORTANT AND IMPACTFUL type of order
				* take a negative position on a stock; i.e., sell a stock short if you believe its price is going to go down 
					* selling stock we don't even own! how?? -- broker facilitation!
		* mechanics of short selling: ENTRY
			* IMB selling at $100
			* you: take a short position on IBM -- want to sell IBM short (don't own any shares)
			* Joe: holds 100 shares IBM -- wants to keep then BUT is willing to lend you shares
			* Lisa: wants to buy IBM
			1. you borrow 100 shares from Joe
			2. you sell those 100 shares to Lisa
			3. in exchange, List gives you $100 per share ($10,000)
			4. you have made 10000 and you now owe Joe 100 IBM shares
		* mechanics of short selling: EXIT
			1. when/if price drops to your specified price, you inform broker to exit (buy to close position -- buy 100 shares) 
				* IBM drops to $90 -- your exit price
					* 90 * 1000 = 9000 -- 10000 - 9000 = 1000 in returns
					* or 100 shares at 100 each share drops to 90, a decrease of 10 -- so 10 * 100 = 1000
			2. you buy a 100 shares and give them back to Joe
			3. you have $1000 and no remaining obligation
		* what can go wrong?
			* IBM prices could go up!	-- you lose money


* what is a company worth?
	* why company value matters:
		* buy below "true" value, sell above "true" value
		* true value: 
			* intrinsic value: based on the value of a company as estimated by future dividends; i.e., companies pay each year or quarter a dividend (cash payment) to share holders -- 
			if i own a share of stock, how much money will i get over the future and what's it worth over all the future going forward
			* book value: based on assets a comany owns -- what does the value of the sum of the assets say the company is worth
			* market cap: based on value of the stock on the market and how many shares are outstanding -- what does the market think the company is worth

		* the value of a future dollar:
			* worth less than a dollar right now -- you can spend it now
			* present value = future value / (1 + interest rate)^i	-- i = how far into the future this payment is going to be delivered -- if delivered right now -- i = 0, if in a year i = 1
			* ex: US gov't IR = 1% -- 1 dollar in the future
				present value = $1.00 / (1 + .01)^1 = 0.99
				i.e., the value of a future dollar from the US gov't is worth .99 -- gov't can charge .99 for 1.00 in a year -- the present value of a dollar in the future (1 year) is .99
				if IR = 5%
				present value = $1.00 / (1 + .05)^1 = 0.95
				i.e., the gov't can only charge you .95 for 1.00 in a year -- the present value of a dollar in the future (1 year) is .95
			* Applied to intrinsic value (dividends):
				* Interest rate analogous to: how risky the company is -- called the discount rate when applied to intrinsic value of a company (dividend payouts)
				* discount rate:
					* higher if the company is more risky	; lower if the company is less risky
				* intrinsic value = value of all future dividends that it will pay out
					* summation:
						infinity
						    E	FV/n^i				---> 	= FV/(n-1) = FV/Discount Rate
						  i = 1
					* i = 1 year to inifinity years	
					* sum of future value / n^i	-- n = (1 + IR)
			




		* intrinsic value:
			*
