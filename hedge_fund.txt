* Assets Under Management (AUM) : How much money is being managed by the fund
* 3 types of funds:
	1. ETF: Exchange Trade Funds: (4 letter symbols)
		* Buy/Sell like stocks
		* Baskets of stocks
		* Transparent
		* High liquidity
		* Fund Manager compensation: -- manner in which they are paid, incentives them to trade or act in certain ways -- based on how much the value of that fund increases
			* According to Expense Ratio (which is some percentage of the AUM) 
			* Usually pretty low (0.01% - 1.00%)
	2. Mutual Funds: (5 letter symbols)
		* Buy/Sell at end of day
		* Quarterly disclosure
			* less transparent
		* Fund Manager compensation: -- manner in which they are paid, incentives them to trade or act in certain ways -- based on how much the value of that fund increases
			* According to Expense Ratio
			* Somewhat higher than ETF's -- (0.5% - 3.00%)
			* These managers use more discretion and supposedly "skill" and so require larger compensation
	3. Hedge Funds: (not symbolized) -- typically have up to only 100 investors
		* Buy/Sell by agreement
		* No disclosure
			* Not transparent
		* Fund Manager compensation: -- manner in which they are paid, incentives them to trade or act in certain ways -- based on how much the value of that fund increases
			* According to "Two and Twenty" (2% AUM + 20% profits) -- "Two" is based on the hedge fund and when they choose to take snap shots of accounting -- usually a blend between some snap 
			shot and the profit return

	ex. Incentives: How are they compensated?
		* Two and Twenty
			* 15% return this year
			* $100,000,000 -> 15% -> $115,000,000

			* "Two" == $100,000,000 * 0.02 = $2,000,000
			* "Twenty" == $15,000,000 * 0.02 = $3,000,000 
				
	ex. Incentives: Which motivates...	Expense ratio		Two and Twenty
			* AUM accumulation		*			*	-- if strictly driven by expense ratio, you will be spending most energy towards accumulating AUM for a higher return
			* Profits						* 	-- only hedge fund managers make a percent of a return(profit) ETFs and Mutual Fund managers only receive expense ratio
			* Risk Taking						*	-- ETFs and MFs managers receive no reward for risk taking; HFs rewarded for risks (profits), & no punishment
											for risks because they still receive the "Two"

* Large Cap = capitalization: i.e., how much is the company worth according to number shares that are outstanding * price of the stock (what 1 share is selling at)
	* outstanding shares: refers to a company's stock currently held by all its shareholders, including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company's officers 
	and insiders

* How funds attract investors for hedge funds:
	* who?
		* individuals:
			* a single person (wealthy) who wants to invest in fund 
			* because a HF typically has only up to 100 investors, they want each of those investment/investor to be fairly large
		* institutions:
			* large retirement funds, university foundations -- very often non-profit institutions that have a very large sum of money that they need to keep somewhere and want to see an accrual 
			in value
		* funds of funds:
			* group together the funds of many individuals or institutions 
			* Manager decides which hedge funds to invest in 

	* why they might invest in your fund?
		* track record:
			* fund has a great track record = good evidence for continual success
			* many investors want to see a good track record for at least 5 years before they'll invest in a particular fund
		* simulation + story:
			* backtest/simulate your strategy
			* simulation must be backed by a very compelling story describing that strategy; i.e., must have a reason for why this method works and it needs to make sense
		* good portfolio fit:
			* how your strategy fits within their portfolio
			* ex., if your strategy is for large cap S&P500 stocks and they already have that covered, they probably wont consider you
			however, if you are looking at small cap growth stocks and they don't yet have that part of their portfolio filled, they'll give you more consideration


* Hedge Fund goals and metrics: when an investor is considering a particular hedge fund, they want to know what are the goals of the hedge funds, and the results of certain metrics
	* Goals:
		* Beat a benchmark (funds):
			* ex. you have a strategy that looks at the stocks in the SP500(SPY: 500 stocks), you are wise at seleting certain SP500 stocks and want to beat the SP500 index as a benchmark
			(the overall SP500 index has good and bad stocks) so if you picked the "good" ones you should beat the SP500 index 
			* Important component: 
				* many benchmarks (like the stock market as a whole) go down, it is of course natural that a portfolio consisting of stocks from that index might go down as well
					* so even though the index and the fund go down, you can outperform the index by going down less and still meet performance goals if index goes down more
		* Absolute return (funds):
			* Goal: provide positive return no matter what
			* usually long/short:
				* they make positive bets in stocks they think are going to go up and negative bets in stocks they think are going to go down 
			* objective: to make slow, gradual positive return no matter what
			* often times, these types of funds don't make the same percentage gains as the beat a benchmark funds, but they have very low drawdowns (i.e., when the market takes a big hit
			 they often don't)
	* Metrics: How to measure how well a fund is meeting its goals
		* cumulative return
			* a measure of aggregate amount an investment has gained or lost over given time -- (val[-1] / val[0]) - 1
			* if fund made 20% over a year, cumulative return is 0.2
		* volatility: Standard deviation of daily returns
			* how rapidly and aggressively the portfolio goes up and down in value -- (daily_ret.std())
		* risk/reward: Sharpe ratio
			* risk adjusted reward -- reward = average daily return - risk free rate ; risk = measure of standard deviation of daily returns
			* multiply by sqrt of k (constant representing frequency of sampling: 252 = daily, 12 = monthly, 1 = yearly)
